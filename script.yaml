        On your hands and knees, you look under the bed to find a stag as small as a housecat.
        Its fur is glowing white with the color of polished ivory; the stag is the source of
        the light trickling across the floor. Its dark eyes are locked on you, afraid. Its
        antlers look like the twigs of a birch tree. You can CRAWL under the bed after it
        or REACH out and offer this small creature your hand.

              light reveals a small tunnel underneath the table. He darts inside. You get back

        You sleep pleasantly and for a long time. You dream of buildings melting slowly into the
        earth. Of orange and red mosaics interlocked, stretching across a sunless sky. Your eyes
        open once more and you feel unnaturally alive. There's sunlight reaching into the room
        through the edges of the door. It makes even the black walls feel warm. As you sit up,
        you catch sight of a small crawlspace in the corner of the room with pale white light
        trickling out of it. Do you CRAWL to investigate or open the DOOR and step outside?

              a small stag that's no bigger than a housecat. His fur is pure white and it glows softly,
              lighting up the dark space. His little antlers look delicate enough to snap between two
              fingers. He sees you and holds your gaze for just a moment before turning around and
              running down the tunnel ahead. In this tight space, he's much faster than you are but you
              crawl on after him just the same.

            Your hand is outstretched. The stag watches it for only a moment and then with the faintest of steps
            it walks towards you pausing just short of touch. You are still. His fur glows white. He steps forward
            pressing his hoof onto your hand. He steps harder. He seems to weigh more than should be possible:
            the hoof pressing firm enough to hurt. He looks up from your hand and locks his eyes with yours.
            They were a deep brown with wide black pupils. They were. As your gazes meet the darkness in the stag's
            eyes begins to change. The blackness of the pupils spreads out across his eyes like squid ink flowing
            over the surface of rich coffee.

            You've been transfixed and surely only moments have passed as the brown disappears below the surface of his
            eyes. There is no life in them. Your hand hurts as he pins it in place with his small hoof. The eyes are
            pitch voids now and just as the last trace of brown is submerged you hear it speak. Its mouth doesn't move,
            of that much you're sure. But the sound fills your mind just the same. You hear/think them say:
            IS NOT MEANT FOR ONE SO SILENT. YOU WHO CANNOT MAKE OUR MUSIC. YOU WHO CANNOT BELONG. FOLLOW THE TALL TREES
            TO THE CLEARING. DRINK WHAT'S OFFERED TO HEAR OUR SONG.

                corner of the room. He must have heard you and he turns back to entertain your gaze. His eyes have
                returned to rich brown. He entertains your gaze for just a moment longer before turning around and

        Your lumbering crawl was no match for the stag's quick canter. You lost sight of him in the tunnel
        ahead. For hours now, you've been crawling onwards in darkness, hands running along the walls but
        feeling nothing but their easy smoothness. Despair begins to set in as you ponder turning around to
        escape this endless black. Your right hand brushes on something distinctly metallic. Salvation? You
        feel along the wall and realize that there are rungs running up it. You reach above your head and
        feel nothing! Your legs ache, but you command them to stand. You curl your toes, relishing the

              ear and in the ooze you hear a low murmur like dozens of tiny voices: muffled and distant. You close
              your eyes, replacing one absolute darkness with another. It advances up over your face, covering your
              mouth and rising up your nostrils. There's no air left. No space. You let out your last breath as
              muffled scream. The sound of distant voices seems to pause for the briefest moment before resuming

              beneath you, and the passageway closes behind you. You find yourself being mysteriously lifted up.
              You wonder if this is what dying feels like, but suddenly the ceiling of the tunnel opens up around you,

        single black goblet. Everything seems to be made of this strange shimmering black material. You sit down. You look
        into the goblet and find a liquid that might be white milk. You give it a swirl and see that the liquid is very

              warm inside. It's pleasant but so strange. You drink it all. You move to place the goblet back on the table.
              Things feel different. Your hand is moving so slowly. It's as if the air has become thick and your movement
              through it is like dragging your arm through mud. You're almost frozen. You command your muscles to move more

              out to grab the goblet but it's soft now and the side of the goblet coats your hand in its thick black goo.
              Then the black ooze drips down off your hand onto the table itself. You pull back. The white liquid spills out
              of the goblet through the hole your fingers just made. When it touches the table, the white vanishes and all you
              see is a small black ripple spread out across the table from the point where the stream made contact. You're
              scared. You push back away from the table and get up and practically run towards the woods. You don't know what

        complicated motion. You stop to investigate it, and notice that there's a small metal cone hanging sideways from
        one of the low branches, open end towards the wind so it whistles gently with each gust. You can pick up the cone

              room seems larger than before; you no longer would need to duck to fit under the doorway; indeed the

            wonder how any force could move such massive instruments. You can WAIT here to watch them make their music or
            WANDER through the forest towards the lake.

            It's happened four times now: the smallest chime mysteriously clanging anew. With each fresh ring you can clearly see
            the chime shaking as if just struck, hard. But you haven't made out what strange force is causing each new knell. That
            chime is hundreds of feet above you. It's too small. The biggest of the chimes is just ten or so feet above your head
            and it's vibrations have slowed visibly since you first laid down. You fix your eyes on it to see if you can catch it
            toll.

            You can't see the great chime moving anymore but you can still hear its sound. Faintly. The pitch seems to be getting
            lower as the chime's sound fades. The big chime is almost silent now; mostly masked by the higher notes of the other chimes.
          delay: 2m

            You move underneath the big chime to get as close as possible and then you notice something new. There's a thick black
            liquid sliding down the inner circumference of the chime. It's very viscous and moving evenly. Almost the entire inside of
            the chime is black now from this slow seeping stream. You understand: the ooze covering the inner wall of the chime must be
            what's causing the sound itself to change.

            The sound in the great chime is very low now and the pitch black substance is almost at its bottom-about to flow out and
            drip onto the ground. Onto you. But right as the liquid touches the lower lip of the chime something happens. The chime's
            sound has formed a strange resonance with the black liquid. You see small waves from far above moving down the substance.
            There's a foot or so between each crest. The first wave hits the bottom edge of the chime and bounces back, traveling up.
            As wave hits wave the interference pattern becomes more and more intricate. The sound is becoming louder and much deeper.
            The waves are taller than they were. They're moving fast.
          delay: 2m
        - say: >
            The ripples are so dense now that you can hardly see the peaks and troughs of each wave. The sound has become a heavy booming hum.
          delay: 1m
        - say: >
            The strange liquid seems almost flat again, save for the subtle rapid vibrations along its surface. The chime hits a final booming
            bass note and suddenly, with incredibly speed, the liquid shoots up the inner wall. It's defying gravity, retreating with the
            viscosity of water being poured along smooth glass. You lose sight of the black substance as it races towards the top of the great
            chime. The briefest moment passes and then entire chime shakes loudly. The note it plays isn't low at all, it's high and crisp
            and magnificent. There's no sign of the liquid now, but you imagine it must be pooled hundreds of feet above you, once again
            beginning its descent down the great chime.

            You've been listening and watching the chimes for many hours now. You've seen their symbiosis with the black ooze. You've watched
            its flow, its building waves, its sudden retreat -the full cycle-play out twice more inside of two of the lesser chimes. Yet, you
            are no closer to fathoming what strange magic could be animating this endless symphony. The chime grove has taught you all it will
            teach. You can continue making your way towards the LAKE or turn back and find a new path through the FOREST.

              will be warm enough to take a swim.
