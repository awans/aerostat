        On your hands and knees, you look under the bed to find a stag as small as a housecat.
        Its fur is glowing white with the color of polished ivory; the stag is the source of
        the light trickling across the floor. Its dark eyes are locked on you, afraid. Its
        antlers look like the twigs of a birch tree. You can CRAWL under the bed after it

              light reveals a small tunnel underneath the table. He darts inside. You get back

        You sleep pleasantly and for a long time. You dream of buildings melting slowly into the
        earth. Of orange and red mosaics interlocked, stretching across a sunless sky. Your eyes
        open once more and you feel unnaturally alive. There's sunlight reaching into the room
        through the edges of the door. It makes even the black walls feel warm. As you sit up,
        you catch sight of a small crawlspace in the corner of the room with pale white light
        trickling out of it. Do you CRAWL to investigate or open the DOOR and step outside?

              a small stag that's no bigger than a housecat. His fur is pure white and it glows softly,
              lighting up the dark space. His little antlers look delicate enough to snap between two
              fingers. He sees you and holds your gaze for just a moment before turning around and
              running down the tunnel ahead. In this tight space, he's much faster than you are but you
              crawl on after him just the same.

        Your lumbering crawl was no match for the stag's quick canter. You lost sight of him in the tunnel

        feeling nothing but their easy smoothness. Despair begins to set in as you ponder turning around to
        escape this endless black. Your right hand brushes on something distinctly metallic. Salvation? You
        feel along the wall and realize that there are rungs running up it. You reach above your head and
        feel nothing! Your legs ache, but you command them to stand. You curl your toes, relishing the

              ear and in the ooze you hear a low murmur like dozens of tiny voices: muffled and distant. You close
              your eyes, replacing one absolute darkness with another. It advances up over your face, covering your

        You notice a hundred feet away ahead of you there is a table. It's smooth and black as pitch. You walk towards it.
        At the closest end of the table there is a black chair and in front of the chair, on the table, there rests a
        single black goblet. Everything seems to be made of this strange shimmering black material. You sit down. You look
        into the goblet and find a liquid that might be white milk. You give it a swirl and see that the liquid is very

              warm inside. It's pleasant but so strange. You drink it all. You move to place the goblet back on the table.
              Things feel different. Your hand is moving so slowly. It's as if the air has become thick and your movement

              out to grab the goblet but it's soft now and the side of the goblet coats your hand in its thick black goo.
              Then the black ooze drips down off your hand onto the table itself. You pull back. The white liquid spills out
              of the goblet through the hole your fingers just made. When it touches the table, the white vanishes and all you
              see is a small black ripple spread out across the table from the point where the stream made contact. You're
              scared. You push back away from the table and get up and practically run towards the woods. You don't know what

            You've been wandering through the trees for many hours now, following the treble notes playing off the breeze. The

            so loud, but you welcome them. They form a boisterous hamory;a choir of perfect voices forever singing a wordless
            song. You crest the final hill and look below. In the distance you see a lake alight with glimmering sunshine. A
            mile or so ahead is a grove of seven great trees that seems to be the source of the symphonic sounds. You walk on

            You step under the canopy of the seven great trees and look up to see magnificent silver chimes hanging from each

            only a dozen or so feet long, to the greatest of the chimes which runs almost the whole height of the tallest treat
            and more than anything resembles a perfectly polished shining smoke stack. The wind is barely blowing now and you

            the chime shaking as if just struck, hard. But you haven't made out what strange force is causing each new knell. That
            chime is hundreds of feet above you. It's too small. The biggest of the chimes is just ten or so feet above your head
            and it's vibrations have slowed visibly since you first laid down. You fix your eyes on it to see if you can catch it

            You move underneath the big chime to get as close as possible and then you notice something new. There's a thick black

            drip onto the ground. Onto you. But right as the liquid touches the lower lip of the chime something happens. The chime's
            sound has formed a strange resonance with the black liquid. You see small waves from far above moving down the substance.
            There's a foot or so between each crest. The first wave hits the bottom edge of the chime and bounces back, traveling up.
            As wave hits wave the interference pattern becomes more and more intricate. The sound is becoming louder and much deeper.

            bass note and suddenly, with incredibly speed, the liquid shoots up the inner wall. It's defying gravity, retreating with the
            viscosity of water being poured along smooth glass. You lose sight of the black substance as it races towards the top of the great
            chime. The briefest moment passes and then entire chime shakes loudly. The note it plays isn't low at all, it's high and crisp
            and magnificent. There's no sign of the liquid now, but you imagine it must be pooled hundreds of feet above you, once again
