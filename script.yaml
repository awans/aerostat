	    You wake up in a dimly lit room. The windowless walls are black, glistening. 
	    Your bed is in the center of the room. Light is creeping out from under it. 
	    Reply with INVESTIGATE to find the source of the light or SLEEP to tumble 
		back into darkness.

		      You sit up. As your foot touches the ground you hear a soft scamper. 
		      You’ve startled something. You pull aside the loose sheets to see what’s 
			  underneath you.

	    On your hands and knees, you look under the bed to find a stag as small as a housecat. 
		Its fur is glowing white with the color of polished ivory; the stag is the source of 
		the light trickling across the floor. Its dark eyes are locked on you, afraid. Its 
		antlers look like the twigs of a birch tree. You can CRAWL under the bed after it 
		or REACH out and offer this small creature your hand.
      actions:
        crawl:
          - say: >
		      The stag sees you moving and turns to run. He races out the other side of the 
			  bed and bolts towards a table in the corner of the room. As he gets closer his 
			  light reveals a small tunnel underneath the table. He darts inside. You get back
			  on your hands and knees and follow him inside.After a struggle, you manage to pull
			  the door open. Whew.

		    The stag’s eyes flick between you and your outstretched hand. He watches you for a

	    You sleep pleasantly and for a long time. You dream of buildings melting slowly into the
	    earth. Of orange and red mosaics interlocked, stretching across a sunless sky. Your eyes
		open once more and you feel unnaturally alive. There’s sunlight reaching into the room 
		through the edges of the door. It makes even the black walls feel warm. As you sit up, 
		you catch sight of a small crawlspace in the corner of the room with pale white light 
		trickling out of it. Do you CRAWL to investigate or open the DOOR and step outside?
      actions:
        crawl:
          - say: >
		    "As you get closer, you see that the crawlspace is a tunnel barely wide enough for 
			you to fit inside. Just a few feet into the tunnel, there is the strangest thing: 
			a small stag that’s no bigger than a housecat. His fur is pure white and it glows softly, 
			lighting up the dark space. His little antlers look delicate enough to snap between two 
			fingers. He sees you and holds your gaze for just a moment before turning around and 
			running down the tunnel ahead. In this tight space, he’s much faster than you are but you 
			crawl on after him just the same."

		    You put your hand against the door and push. The black wood is surprisingly soft to your touch. 
			It’s very bright outside and it takes your eyes just a moment to adjust.
